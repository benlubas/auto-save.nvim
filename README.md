A very simple autosave plugin b/c the project I forked from was unmaintained and _very_ bloated.

Features:
- 135ms debounce
- Save the current file on InsertLeave and TextChanged
- don't try to save non-modifiable files or oil buffer or harpoon buffer
- don't print anything ever
- no colors
- no configuration
- no setup
- `ASToggle` command to toggle
